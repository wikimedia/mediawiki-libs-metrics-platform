In this case, I don\u0027t think there is any major issues if they are desynchronized, so feel free to ignore all this.\n\nI think that this indicates the need to have a Configuration object that encapsulate those 2 variables and represents how we interact with configuration. This is probably out of the scope of this CR.\n\nThread safety is hard! This might be the occasion to talk about it in more details if you are up to it.",
