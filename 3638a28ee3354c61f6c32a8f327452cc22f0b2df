      "message": "Whoa - that is a radical simplification bordering on voodoo (stream api is magic to me) ðŸ˜Š\n\nThe only thing I can think of to make the case for manually deserializing is that there is some manipulation of the DestinationEventService (DES herein for short -- i.e. recent fix of needing to append the right path + param to the DES baseUri) in StreamConfigFetcher::parseDestinationEventService() which calls `.fromName(DESstringFromApiEndpoint)`. I\u0027m guessing there\u0027s a way to include this transform somehow?  I\u0027ll see if I can noodle on that part.\n\nFwiw I tested locally with multiple event submissions and i\u0027m seeing them validate in my local eventgate - nice! but that bypasses what DES is returned in the fetched stream config because in my current tedious testing flow, i manually return the local DES when enqueued events are processed/submitted.\n\ncc\u0027ing Guillaume too for another set of eyes",
