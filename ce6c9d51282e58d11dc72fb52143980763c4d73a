Maybe we could take 10 minutes and you could show me what\u0027s triggering the error that needs fixing?\n\n---\n\nThe issue was that performer.session_id in integration_data.json was invalid.\n\nYour patch improves the consistency test by using a real-world stream configuration, which includes a sampling rate (100% of all sessions). Unfortunately for me, the contrived session ID that I\u0027d set in integration_data.json was invalid and was causing SamplingController.streamInSample() to return false. I\u0027ve updated the session ID.",
